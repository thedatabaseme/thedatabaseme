# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Philip or TheDatabaseMe, nice that you step by on my Github Profile. Who am I you might ask, here for you really short:

I'm in IT for over 23 years now. Proud Oracle certified Professional (OCP 11g, 12c) and Oracle certified Tuning Expert, cat fan, lovable choleric, still not 40 years old (yes, this is obviously a lie) And owner of the one ring. I'm just kidding, I'm not loveable. :grin:
Lot's of my free time is spend in tech related stuff which outcome you can find here on my Github Profile or my [Blog](https://www.thedatabaseme.de). If you like a tweet here and there, you also can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedatabaseme).
